{- $usage
You can use this module with the following in your @~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs@:

> import XMonad.Actions.Warp

then add appropriate keybindings to warp the pointer; for example:

> , ((modm,   xK_z     ), warpToWindow (1%2) (1%2)) -- @@ Move pointer to currently focused window
>
>-- mod-ctrl-{w,e,r} @@ Move mouse pointer to screen 1, 2, or 3
>
>   [((modm .|. controlMask, key), warpToScreen sc (1%2) (1%2))
>       | (key, sc) <- zip [xK_w, xK_e, xK_r] [0..]]

Note that warping to a particular screen may change the focus.

-- For detailed instructions on editing your key bindings, see
-- "XMonad.Doc.Extending#Editing_key_bindings".


data Corner = UpperLeft | UpperRight | LowerLeft | LowerRight

{- | Move the mouse cursor to a corner of the focused window. Useful for
   uncluttering things.

   Internally, this uses numerical parameters. We parametrize on the 'Corner'
   type so the user need not see the violence inherent in
   the system.

   'warpToScreen' and 'warpToWindow' can be used in a variety of
   ways. Suppose you wanted to emulate Ratpoison's \'banish\' command,
   which moves the mouse pointer to a corner? warpToWindow can do that! -}
